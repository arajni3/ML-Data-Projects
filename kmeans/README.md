# K-Means Clustering Implementation
My coding homework for Homework 4 of the Spring 2021 offering of CS 446 at UIUC. hw4 implements Lloyd's algorithm for k-means, and hw4_utils is a helper file for hw4. The png files in this folder are plots of the clusters and the respective clusters' centroids at a particular step in the implementation of Lloyd's algorithm. The comments in hw4 further explain the plots.
