# Residual Neural Network Implementation
My coding homework for Homework 3 of the Spring 2021 offering of CS 446 at UIUC. The file hw3 implements a residual neural network (ResNet), a block used for the residual neural network, and a 1-nearest-neighbors classifier; 1nn_voronoi is the Voronoi diagram of a specific data set that can be found in hw3_utils. hw3_utils provides functions and datasets that **hw3** uses.
