# Residual Neural Network Implementation
hw3.py implements a residual neural network (ResNet) and a block used for the residual neural network. hw3.py also implements a 1-nearest-neighbors classifier; 1nn_voronoi is the Voronoi diagram of a specific data set that can be found in hw3_utils. hw3_utils provides functions and datasets that hw3.py uses.
